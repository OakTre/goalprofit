							|	Dynamic pricing is a pricing strategy where fixed prices are replaced with variable prices. Typically, a business will set prices at a certain amount when going into a specific season. In contrast, dynamic pricing will involve multiple price changes within a day.
						h2 Factors affecting Dynamic Pricing

						p
							|	A business will have to worry about increased price transparency. Specifically in e-commerce, consumers are able to compare different online shops’ prices and also consult with friends. This means that you need to be able to access just about any price-related data the consumer can access and factor it into your decision-making process.
						p
							|	The capacity to change prices rapidly. <b>Since consumers</b> can view prices from different websites and other sources, you need to be able to have the ideal price that will make a consumer settle on your offer in the end. This inevitably means having a lot of price changes, so a business needs to build that capability or find the right solution to always react promptly.
